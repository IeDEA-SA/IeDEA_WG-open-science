# Few github pointers.

## Accounts

Our organisation is [IeDEA-SA](https://github.com/IeDEA-SA). 

Once you sign up for github and pass me your surname you will become member of this organization.

You can visit the [team page](https://github.com/orgs/IeDEA-SA/people) and see who is doing what. Pay attention to the user names - we will use them to notify people in different communication channels and assign them to tasks.

## Repository

We are using repository [WG_open-science](https://github.com/IeDEA-SA/WG_open-science) to test project management a bit. 

`IeDEA-SA` organisation is the owner. And you have been added as collaborator on this repository. 

## Issues

Key ingredient of working with github for non-coding projects is to master the idea of [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/#:~:text=Issues%20are%20a%20great%20way,own%20section%20in%20every%20repository.).

Our issues are located [here](https://github.com/IeDEA-SA/WG_open-science/issues). Feel free to add new ones, assign people to them, or comment on existing ones. 

## Project

For project management purposes issues can be arranged into a [project](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards) and tracked across the stages of the project. Our project is located [here](https://github.com/IeDEA-SA/WG_open-science/projects/1)

## Milestones

As a bonus feature you might also read a bit about [milestones](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-milestones) - we might consdier using them later to track more complex projects. 

## More project info tools

Can be added using [Wiki pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-wikis) or new feature of [Dicsussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions). Currently we do not have wiki here (not available in free tier) but we can use discussion [here](https://github.com/IeDEA-SA/WG_open-science/discussions)
